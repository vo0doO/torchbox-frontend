Welcome to GraphiQL

GraphiQL is an in-browser tool for writing, validating, and
testing GraphQL queries.

Type queries into this side of the screen, and you will see intelligent
typeaheads aware of the current GraphQL type schema and live syntax and
validation errors highlighted within the text.

GraphQL queries typically start with a "{" character. Lines that starts
with a # are ignored.

An example GraphQL query might look like:

    {
      field(arg: "value") {
        subField
      }
    }

Keyboard shortcuts:

  Prettify Query:  Shift-Ctrl-P (or press the prettify button above)

       Run Query:  Ctrl-Enter (or press the play button above)

   Auto Complete:  Ctrl-Space (or just start typing)
